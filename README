Definitions for swiping behavior (implemented in onTouch() in SwipeView):

swiping off a non-character key to a character key or an empty area => do nothing
		 (Delete Key IS an exception since it is repeatable!)
swiping off a non-character key to a non-character key => interpret end position
swiping off a character key to a non-character key => do nothing
Any touch related behavior using swipe not defined is considered bug. In which case it should be reported (or fixed)
