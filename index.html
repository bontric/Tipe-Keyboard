<a name="what-is-tipe" class="anchor" href="#what-is-tipe"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Tipe?</h2>

<p>Tipe stands for Tap &amp; Swipe and offers the user a new typing experience on Android smartphones. 
Tipe is designed to give users the ability to type without auto correction and annoying errors. Instead of shrinking a full sized keyboard we only use 6 buttons. Tipe is developed by two studends and should therefore be concidered a <em>concept</em> since we are not able to implement fancy features payed keyboards have. Tipe itself and the concept are young 
and might improve in the future. we are not able to tell what the future will bring. 
When using Tipe you should issue any idea you have to improve the concept. </p>

<a name="what-tipe-is-not" class="anchor" href="#what-tipe-is-not"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Tipe is NOT</h2>

<p>Tipe is concidered a <em>concept</em> study to improve typing on smartphones. We'll try to improve it as much as we can
but we might not have the time to implement every little featre. </p>

<h2>
<a name="how-to-use" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use</h2>

<p>When holding down one buton the characters inside that button get distributed on all the buttons. While still holding down you swipe to the character you want to type. 
When using this keyboard you should learn the <em>moves</em> pretty fast. As soon as you know where single characters are placed you'll be able to type easily as fast as with a normal softkeyboard. The biggest differnece is, due to the bigger buttons, that you'll be able to type with percision. </p>

<p>We are grateful for any help. Just send us an email and we'll answer as fast as we can. You don't need to be a professional since we ourselfes are rather newbies to android developing.</p>
